A bit about history
-------------------

DiskBase began as a set of DOS command line utilities sometime around 
year 1988 I guess. At this time it was named QuickDir and I made it for 
my own need and also gave it to my friends. Some years it was 
functioning well, my friends were really using it, but then it started 
to be clear, that it must get a real GUI. I was using Delphi at this 
time, so I have developed with Delphi 1.0 a 16-bit version and with 
Delphi 2.0 a 32-bit version. As QuickDir was already used name of 
somebody's else program, I have changed the name to DiskBase and started 
to sell it as a shareware. 

The 16-bit and 32-bit versions coexisted for a long time. The 16-bit 
version support was terminated in version 5.11, however, relicts from 
the compatibility with Delphi 1.0 still remain; for example, some of the 
Win32 window controls are not used - the Tree panel is implemented with 
Borland's OutlineTree component and not with the TreeView component, 
representing Win32 control, used for example in Windows Explorer.

I have worked on DiskBase namely in the years, when I was employed at a 
university; at that time I had enough power and free time. However, as 
salaries at Czech universities were shamefully low and I had my family 
living in a quite odd flat, I decided to go to a private company as a 
programmer. This happened in 1996 and since that time I became quite 
busy and exhausted, so that I did not have much power to develop 
DiskBase further. For a long time I was still optimistic about returning 
to it, I even had prepared a complete new base of code in C++ to start 
DiskBase 7 from the scratch, so that I could make a substantially better 
program design. But after some other troubles came, it was clear to me 
that I will not be able to continue in the development anymore. 

DiskBase was never a big commercial success; today I am almost sure the 
error was not in the program itself (I got quite a lot of praise from 
existing users), but in almost none publicity, which I significantly 
underestimated.

Due to continuing requests from DiskBase users I did not terminate the 
development, but was searching somebody who would take it over. After a 
failure to find anybody, I finally decided to make the source code 
public domain. Hopefully somebody will it interesting and will be able 
to implement the new features, which are the users requiring.

In the Description.txt is a rough description. The truth is that after years,
I have forgot almost the whole code, which I was originally holding fully in my
head. But still if something is needed to be explained, please do not 
hesitate to contact me, I will have a look, and if I will understand it 
:-) I will explain.
